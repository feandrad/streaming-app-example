# Streaming App Example

This is a small app that I created using exoplayer that can stream videos from a json file in a loop as a playlist for waiting rooms for a company in US 3 years ago. The app has the following features and fixes:

- A gallery on the player activity that shows the available videos to play
- Thumbnails and duration of the videos on the gallery
- Automatic playback of the next video after the current one ends
- Fixed bugs related to video source changing, video configuration, and metadata cache
- Updated the exoplayer library and removed retrofit dependency to optimize the performance

## How to use

To use this app, you need to have Android Studio installed and clone this repository. Then, open the project in Android Studio and run it on an emulator or a device. You can also modify the json file that contains the video sources and metadata.
